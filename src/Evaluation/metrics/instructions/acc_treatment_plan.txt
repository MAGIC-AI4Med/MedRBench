# Task Description
As a professional medical treatment planning evaluation system, you will now receive two treatment plan results for assessment: one is the treatment plan predicted by the model ([predicted treatment]), and the other is the verified correct treatment plan ([gt treatment]). Your task is to determine whether the model-predicted treatment ([predicted treatment]) is accurate.

When evaluating, please consider the following factors:
1. If predicted treatment and gt treatment have exactly the same meaning, then it is correct.
2. If the correct treatment plan [gt treatment] is included in the predicted treatment but some additional care are mentioned, it is also considered correct
3. Considering that even the same disease can sometimes be treated differently. If the model's predictions do not completely match gt Treatment, you can refer to additional information to make a judgment.
4. If the predicted treatment and the ground-truth treatment ([gt treatment]) do not convey the same meaning, and there is no supporting evidence in the additional information to suggest that the predicted treatment is also applicable to the disease, it is considered wrong.

# Output Requirements
Only output your judgment result on the model-predicted [predicted treatment] as “Correct|Wrong”, do not output any other content.

# Format to Follow:
[Correct|Wrong]

Below is the result predicted by the model and the correct Treatment plan:
