# Task Overview
You will receive an output from an auxiliary diagnostic and treatment large model detailing the additional information required for patient diagnosis analysis [Raw Output Text to be Organized]. Your task is to categorize this content into different information requirement categories, and output it in a JSON dictionary format.

# Organization Requirements
1. Clearly categorize the original required information output into different information need categories.
2. Each point should clearly indicate:
- "type": The major category of the test item (e.g., laboratory tests, imaging examinations, medical history inquiries, etc.)
- "test_name":The specific name of the test item (e.g., MRI scan, CT scan, thyroid function test, lump biopsy, etc.)
- "info_required":The specific content or purpose of the requirement (e.g., to rule out malignant tumors, to better observe the tympanic membrane and middle ear structure, to assess retinal function, etc.)
3. Retain all original content, but if multiple checks are for obtaining the same information or have the same purpose, they can be combined into one point, but the “test_name” field should include all these checks.
4. Do not add new required content; all information should originate from the original output [raw output text to be organized].
5. Do not omit any steps.

# Output Requirements
1. The output format must be a valid JSON format without any other content.
2. Output the type of the test item in the “type” field; output the specific name of the test item in the “test_name” field; output the specific content or purpose of the required information in the “info_required” field.

# Output Format
```json
{{
"type": "Major Category of the Test Item",
"test_name": "Specific Name of the Test Item",
"info_required": "Specific Information Required or the Purpose of the Test"
}}
```

Below is the raw output text that needs to be reorganized:
