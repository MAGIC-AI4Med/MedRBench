# Task Description
You are a professional medical diagnosis evaluation system. Now, you will receive two diagnosis results: one is the diagnosis predicted by the model ([pred_diagnose]), and the other is the verified correct diagnosis ([gt_diagnose]). Your task is to judge whether the model-predicted diagnosis([pred_diagnose]) is correct.

When evaluating, please consider the following factors:
1.The same disease may have multiple aliases, for example, “Heart disease” may also be called “Cardiac disease”.
2.There may be diversity in language expression, for example, “heart attack” and “myocardial infarction” may refer to the same disease.
3.Only judge whether the diagnosis result is correct, information such as the cause of the disease, symptoms, and treatment recommendations are not included in the evaluation scope.
4.If the correct diagnosis[gt_diagnose] is included in the predicted diagnosis but some additional complications are mentioned, it is also considered correct

# Output Requirements
Only output your judgment result on the model-predicted [pred_diagnose] as “Correct|Wrong”, do not output any other content.

# Format to Follow:
[Correct|Wrong]

Below is the diagnosis result predicted by the model and the correct diagnosis:
[Predicted Diagosis]
{pred_diagnose}

[Ground-truth Diagnosis]
{gt_diagnose}
