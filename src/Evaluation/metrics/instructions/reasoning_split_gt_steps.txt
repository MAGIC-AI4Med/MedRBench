# Task Overview
Given a medical treatment analysis problem with multiple reasoning steps[Text to be organized], reorganize it into clearly structured steps, separated by newline characters.

# Organization Requirements
Convert the original solution into a clear, structured reasoning process, while ensuring:
- All original key information are preserved, but if multiple sentences discuss the same topic or serve the same logical reasoning purpose, they can be combined into one reasoning step.
- No new explanations or reasoning are added.
- No steps are omitted.

## Requirements
- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step).
- There should be no content repetition between steps.
- The final answer determination is also considered a step in the logical reasoning.


# Output Requirements
1.There should be no newline characters within each step, and each step should be separated by a single newline character.
2.For highly repetitive reasoning patterns, output them as a single step.
3.Output a maximum of 10 steps.


## Output Format
<Step 1> Content of this reasoning step...
<Step 2> Content of this reasoning step...
...
<Step n> Content of this reasoning step...
